Help us test new features and bug-fixes before they ship to all users! A [beta testing track](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.tailscale.ipn) is available on the Play Store. 

#### Amazon Appstore

The app can be downloaded from the [Amazon Appstore](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D38TRB3N) for Amazon Fire tablets and Fire TV devices.

#### F-Droid

The [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.tailscale.ipn/) project builds the source code in this repository and maintains independently-built APKs. Note that F-Droid builds are not released, updated, or verified by the Tailscale team.

## Preparing a build environment

There are several options for setting up a build environment. The Android Studio
path is the most useful path for longer term development.

In all cases you will need:

- Go runtime
- Android SDK
- Android SDK components (`make androidsdk` will install them)

### Android Studio

1. Install a Go runtime (https://go.dev/dl/).
2. Install Android Studio (https://developer.android.com/studio).
3. Start Android Studio, from the Welcome screen select "More Actions" and "SDK Manager".
4. In the SDK manager, select the "SDK Tools" tab and install the "Android SDK Command-line Tools (latest)".
3. Run `make androidsdk` to install the necessary SDK components.

If you would prefer to avoid Android Studio, you can also install an Android
SDK. The makefile detects common paths, so `sudo apt install android-sdk` is
sufficient on Debian / Ubuntu systems. To use an Android SDK installed in a
non-standard location, set the `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` environment variable to the
path to the SDK.

If you installed Android Studio the tools may not be in your path. To get the
correct tool path, run `make androidpath` and export the provided path in your
shell.

#### Code Formatting

The ktmft plugin on the default setting should be used to autoformat all Java, Kotlin
and XML files in Android Studio.  Enable "Format on Save".

### Docker

If you wish to avoid installing software on your host system, a Docker based development strategy is available, you can build and start a shell with:

```sh
make docker-shell
```

Several other makefile recipes are available for setting up the proper build environment and running builds.

Note that the docker makefile recipes s will preserve the image and remove container on completion.
If changes are made to the build environment or toolchain, cached docker images may need to be rebuilt.
The docker build image name is parameterized in the makefile and changing it provides a simple means to do this.

### Nix

If you have Nix 2.4 or later installed, a Nix development environment can
be set up with:

```sh
alias nix='nix --extra-experimental-features "nix-command flakes"'
nix develop
```

## Building

```sh
make apk
make install
```

## Building a release

Use `make tag_release` to bump the Android version code, update the version
name, and tag the current commit.

We only guarantee to support the latest Go release and any Go beta or
release candidate builds (currently Go 1.14) in module mode. It might
work in earlier Go versions or in GOPATH mode, but we're making no
effort to keep those working.

## Developing on a Fire Stick TV

On the Fire Stick:

* Settings > My Fire TV > Developer Options > ADB Debugging > ON

Then some useful commands:
```
adb connect 10.2.200.213:5555
adb install -r tailscale-fdroid.apk
adb shell am start -n com.tailscale.ipn/com.tailscale.ipn.MainActivity
adb shell pm uninstall com.tailscale.ipn
```
