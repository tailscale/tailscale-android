## Building

[Go](https://golang.org), the [Android
SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools), 
the [Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk) are required.

```sh
$ make tailscale-debug.apk
$ adb install -r tailscale-debug.apk
```

The `dockershell` target builds a container with the necessary
dependencies and runs a shell inside it.

```sh
$ make dockershell
# make tailscale-debug.apk
```

If you have Nix 2.4 or later installed, a Nix development environment can
be set up with

```sh
$ alias nix='nix --extra-experimental-features "nix-command flakes"'
$ nix develop
```

Use `make tag_release` to bump the Android version code, update the version
name, and tag the current commit.

We only guarantee to support the latest Go release and any Go beta or
release candidate builds (currently Go 1.14) in module mode. It might
work in earlier Go versions or in GOPATH mode, but we're making no
effort to keep those working.

## Google Sign-In

Google Sign-In support relies on configuring a [Google API Console
project](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/android/start-integrating)
with the app identifier and [signing key
hashes](https://developers.google.com/android/guides/client-auth).
The official release uses the app identifier `com.tailscale.ipn`;
custom builds should use a different identifier.

## Running in the Android emulator

By default, the android emulator uses an older version of OpenGL ES,
which results in a black screen when opening the Tailscale app. To fix
this, with the emulator running:

 - Open the three-dots menu to access emulator settings
 - To to `Settings > Advanced`
 - Set "OpenGL ES API level" to "Renderer maximum (up to OpenGL ES 3.1)"
 - Close the emulator.
 - In Android Studio's emulator view (that lists all your emulated
   devices), hit the down arrow by the virtual device and select "Cold
   boot now" to restart the emulator from scratch.

The Tailscale app should now render correctly.

Additionally, there seems to be a bug that prevents using the
system-level Google sign-in option (the one that pops up a
system-level UI to select your Google account). You can work around
this by selecting "Other" at the sign-in screen, and then selecting
Google from the next screen.
